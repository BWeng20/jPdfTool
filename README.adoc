= jPdfTool

Apache PDFBox based tool to modify PDFs without paying any money.

This project began when I needed to protect a scanned PDF for an email, but the HP Scanner software couldn’t handle it. My old Brother scanner had this feature - plus other useful tools - and (by the way) worked without requiring any registration. +
Rather than paying for Adobe or other commercial solutions, I turned to the PDFBox documentation.  +
I had used PDFBox in previous commercial projects, though I’d never dealt with PDF protection before.

Thirty minutes later, the first version was up and running, and I sent the email. +
The following days were spent adding fancy features to the UI and the build system - just for fun.

== Current Features

image:doc/Screenshot Release2.1.png[Screenshot]

=== Load a PDF

Easily import PDF documents for editing

=== Merge Multiple PDFs

Add additional PDFs and either mix pages or append them sequentially.

=== Set Owner and User Passwords

You can simply set a user password to restrict who can view the document. +
Or you can set an owner password and control specific permissions. +
Or you can do both.

=== Enable/Disable Compression

Toggle compression to optimize file size.

=== Set Permissions

Permissions only take effect when an owner password is set. +
The UI automatically disables permission checkboxes unless the password is provided.

=== Remove &amp; Rearrange Pages

Delete pages or change their order.

=== Rotate Pages

Rotate pages by 90°, 180° or 270°.

=== Preview PDF

For you convenience the document is shown using PDFBox’s rendering engine
(rending runs in background).

=== Export Embedded Images

Display and export embedded images. +
Some PDF tools seems to split images into fragments - this tool can provide a merged version for you.

=== Convert Page to a single Image

This effectively removes any hidden objects if you e.g. tried to redact documents but hidden text- or image-objects are still in the document. +

=== Load Protected PDFs

Allows you to remove or change existing passwords. +
If the current entered owner password does not match the original password of the loaded PDF, the UI will prompt you to
enter the correct one. +
This password input is masked and will not be shown in the UI afterward.

=== Store the File

Saves your modified PDF.

=== Split into Multiple Documents

Export the PDF into separate documents.

=== Switch "Look-And-Feels"

Toggle between FlatLaf Dark/Light themes or system defaults. +
The setting is stored in user-preferences.

=== Sign the File with a Certificate

Sign the file using a certificate. +
A `.p12` file with an X.509 certificate is required.

== TODOs

E-mail me if I missed important features. 

== Supported Operating Systems

Distributions are currently only created for *MS Windows*.

The OS-dependent components are only the starter executable and the bundled JRE, designed to make it eeeeasy for Windows users.

The included JAR files in the `lib` folder should run on *any operating system with Java installed*.

For example, on *Linux* or *macOS*, you can run the application using the following command:

[source,console]
----
java -cp "$(printf %s: lib/*.jar)" com.bw.jPdfTool.Main
----

This command simply adds all JARs in the lib folder to the classpath.
The main class is `com.bw.jPdfTool.Main`.
Calling it without any arguments will launch the *Graphical User Interface (GUI)*.

== Command Line Interface (CLI)

In case you need to call the tool from a *CI/CD Pipeline* or script,
you can use the CLI. +
I assume you have a basic understanding of command-line operations.

*Prerequisites:*

* The current directory of your shell (e.g. Bash) is in the distribution root directory.
* You have a *Java Runtime Environment (JRE)* installed - _see below for *headless* environments_.

To show the usage information of the CLI, use:

[source,console]
----
java -cp "$(printf %s: lib/*.jar)" com.bw.jPdfTool.Main -h
----

*Note:* The CLI currently supports only a subset of the tool's total functionality. +
Feel free to ask in case you need special functionality.

=== Headless Environment Considerations

Because the tool uses *PDFBox* for all the magic, there are special considerations for headless environments:
+ *GUI is not created for CLI:* If the CLI is used, the User Interface is not created, so it should run on a headless system (a server without a display).
+ *AWT Dependency:* PDFBox internally uses some *Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT)* classes. These classes may require a *full JRE* to work, even if the application is running "off-screen" without a physical display installed.
+ *Pure Headless JRE Risk:* A _pure_ headless JRE might throw an error when an AWT class is instantiated. While you might use the CLI on a headless system, using a JRE specifically configured as _purely_ headless may be problematic.

*Recommendation:* Try running it. Success depends on the specific headless JRE implementation you are using.
